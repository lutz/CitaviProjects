## FAQ

1. Start Citavi.
2. Open the macro editor  (_Tools > Macro Editor..._)
3. Remove the template code and paste the macro code.
4. Press the **Compile** button.
5. If no erros showed in the error list, press the **Run** button

### How do I install an addon?

1. Shut down Citavi.
2. Download the desired add-on from the Internet (usually a ZIP archive).
3. Unzip the ZIP archive with the right mouse button using the command "Extract All".
4. Copy the unzipped files into the directory "[installation directory]\AddOns" (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Citavi 6\AddOns`). You may have to create the folder _AddOns_ when using it for the first time!
5. Start Citavi

### Is there any cost associated with using macros or addons?

You may freely use, modify and distribute the macros and addons available here for any purpose or cost. Please note only the license terms under which these macros and addons are published.

### I want develop my own addon. How can i find material?

There is no official documentation or instructions for programming Citavi add-ons. The first way should be via the old German tutorial on Citavi 3 add-ons, which can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Citavi/C6-Add-Ons-and-Online-Sources/wiki) of the public [Citavi 6 add-on repository](https://github.com/Citavi/C6-Add-Ons-and-Online-Sources). Although this is an old tutorial, the basic principles are the same. In addition, there are several examples of add-ons, whose source code gives a first overview. Also my add-ons published [here](https://github.com/lutz/CitaviProjects#addons) can be viewed and developed further.
